Description: rmaxima provides an interface to the powerful and fairly complete computer algebra system maxima.
    It can be used to start and control maxima from within R by entering maxima commands. 
    It facilitates outputting results from maxima in LaTeX and MathML. 2 and 3D plots can be displayed directly,
    printed to files or used within RMarkdown documents. This package also registers a knitr-engine 
    enabling maxima code chunks to be written in RMarkdown documents.
