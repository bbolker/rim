Description: provides an interface to the powerful and fairly complete computer algebra system maxima.
    It can be used to start and control maxima from within R by entering maxima commands. 
    It facilitates outputting results from maxima in LaTeX and MathML. 2D and 3D plots can be displayed directly,
    printed to files or used within RMarkdown documents. This package also registers a knitr-engine 
    enabling maxima code chunks to be written in RMarkdown documents.
